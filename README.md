# Solar Energy Generation Analysis and Forecasting

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting solar energy generation based on various meteorological and atmospheric conditions. The goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to understand the relationship between weather conditions and solar power generation, improve forecasting accuracy, and optimize energy efficiency. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, time series forecasting, and anomaly detection.

###@ Key Insights

**Model Performance**:
- The Random Forest model achieved an RÂ² Score of 0.9266, indicating that 92.66% of the variance in solar power output is explained by the features.
- The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was 0.0344 MW, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was 0.0675 MW, suggesting high accuracy in predictions.

**Feature Importance**:
- DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance) and GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) were the strongest predictors of solar power output, highlighting the importance of solar radiation in energy production.
- Wind Speed, Pressure, and Ozone had minimal impact on power generation.

**Trends and Patterns**:
- Solar power output varies significantly across time and seasons, with higher generation during daylight hours and in sunnier months.
- The heatmap revealed location-specific variations in solar power generation, which can be used to optimize solar panel placement.

**Anomalies**:
- Anomalies in solar power output were detected, possibly indicating equipment issues, unusual weather events, or data errors.

**Forecasting**:
- The Prophet model successfully forecasted solar energy generation for the next 30 days, enabling better energy planning and grid management.
